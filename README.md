# CMake Templates

Templates for creating C/C++ projects with CMake.  
Every template contains an example, but those are kept at a minimum (only an executable and a static library).

Where applicable GogleTest is included by default and linked to CTest.

## Structure of templates

Templates are build following the structure presented in ["An Introduction to Modern CMake"](https://cliutils.gitlab.io/modern-cmake/chapters/basics/structure.html).
